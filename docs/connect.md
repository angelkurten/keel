# Connect your events

Keel ingests envelopes, never raw rows. Every source produces the same shape, and the cartridge's handlers are the only code that reads a payload. Pick the source that matches where your events already are.

## The envelope

One event, as the development adapter reads it from `examples/events/fleet.jsonl`:

```json
{"tenant": "acme-logistics", "type": "unit.registered", "subject": "unit:MXK-4821",
 "occurred_at": "2026-09-01T09:00:00Z", "source": "fleet.vehicles",
 "payload": {"id": "MXK-4821", "plate": "MXK-4821", "model": "Freightliner Cascadia"}}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tenant` | yes | The end-customer this fact belongs to. Opaque to Keel. |
| `type` | yes | Dotted lowercase type from the cartridge catalog. |
| `subject` | yes | `<kind>:<id>` of the entity the fact is about. |
| `occurred_at` | yes | When it happened in the world. Timezone-aware. |
| `source` | yes | System of record or adapter name. |
| `id` | no | Generated when absent. Becomes the `evidence` of derived facts. |
| `recorded_at` | no | When Keel learned it. Defaults to now. |
| `payload` | no | Event data. Only handlers read it. |

The full rules are in the [specification](SPEC.md#2-event-envelope).

## A `.jsonl` file

For development and tests. One envelope per line; blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.

```bash
uv run keel ingest cartridges/fleet examples/events/fleet.jsonl
```

## A Postgres outbox table

Your SaaS inserts envelopes into a table. Keel polls it in order and remembers the last row it took in a cursor file, so a restart resumes instead of re-ingesting.

```sql
CREATE TABLE keel_events (
    seq          bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
    id           text NOT NULL,
    tenant       text NOT NULL,
    type         text NOT NULL,
    subject      text NOT NULL,
    occurred_at  timestamptz NOT NULL,
    recorded_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    source       text NOT NULL,
    payload      jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'
);
```

```bash
uv sync --extra postgres
```

```python
import psycopg

from keel import Ingestor, MemoryStore, load_cartridge
from keel.adapters.postgres import PostgresTableAdapter

ingestor = Ingestor(load_cartridge("cartridges/fleet"), MemoryStore())
adapter = PostgresTableAdapter(lambda: psycopg.connect(DSN), table="keel_events", cursor_path=".keel/cursor")

ingestor.ingest(adapter)                      # one pass over everything after the cursor
ingestor.ingest(adapter.follow(interval=5))   # or poll forever
```

Delivery is at-least-once: the cursor advances after the consumer has taken an event, so a crash mid-event re-delivers it. The table name, the cursor column and the batch size are parameters. Any DB-API 2.0 connection works; pass `placeholder="?"` for sqlite3.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Your SaaS
    participant T as keel_events
    participant A as PostgresTableAdapter
    participant C as cursor file
    participant I as Ingestor
    S->>T: INSERT envelope (seq 41)
    A->>C: read position
    C-->>A: 40
    A->>T: SELECT * WHERE seq > 40 ORDER BY seq LIMIT 500
    T-->>A: row 41
    A->>I: Event 41
    I->>I: dispatch to the handler
    I->>A: next event?
    A->>C: write 41
    Note over A,I: a crash before "write 41" re-delivers event 41 on restart
```

!!! warning "Concurrent writers"
    A serial cursor can skip a row that commits late while a later row was already read. Use one writer per table, or a `recorded_at` cursor with a lag, if that bites.

## A webhook

Keel receives envelopes over HTTP, validates them and ingests them in the request.

```bash
uv sync --extra webhook
```

```python
# app.py
from keel import Ingestor, MemoryStore, load_cartridge
from keel.adapters.webhook import build_app

ingestor = Ingestor(load_cartridge("cartridges/fleet"), MemoryStore())
app = build_app(ingestor, token="shared-secret")
```

```bash
uv run uvicorn app:app --port 8000
curl -X POST localhost:8000/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer shared-secret" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"tenant": "acme-logistics", "type": "unit.registered", "subject": "unit:MXK-4821", "occurred_at": "2026-09-01T09:00:00Z", "source": "fleet.vehicles", "payload": {"id": "MXK-4821", "plate": "MXK-4821", "model": "Freightliner Cascadia"}}]'
```

The body is one envelope or a list. The response is the ingest report: `processed`, `unhandled` types and `errors`. A malformed envelope is a `422`; a wrong token is a `401`. Without a token the endpoint accepts any caller, so use that only on localhost.

## Serve the tools over MCP

```bash
uv sync --extra mcp
uv run keel serve cartridges/fleet --tenant acme-logistics --events examples/events/fleet.jsonl
```

With Claude Code, one command registers the server. The agent sees exactly five tools and nothing else:

```bash
claude mcp add keel -- uv run --directory $PWD keel serve cartridges/fleet --tenant acme-logistics --events examples/events/fleet.jsonl
```

With Codex CLI (OpenAI), declare the server in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Keel annotates `context`, `history`, `search` and `related` as read-only, so Codex runs them without asking even under `approval_policy = "never"`; `annotate` writes, so it prompts unless you set `default_tools_approval_mode = "auto"` on the server:

```toml
[mcp_servers.keel]
command = "uv"
args = ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/keel", "keel", "serve", "cartridges/fleet", "--tenant", "acme-logistics", "--events", "examples/events/fleet.jsonl"]
startup_timeout_sec = 60
```

A headless run, for a smoke test or CI:

```bash
codex exec --json "Which tires on unit:MXK-4821 are critical according to the cartridge's own rules? Use only the keel tools." < /dev/null
```

Checked on 2026-10-14 with Codex CLI 0.162 and `openai/gpt-5.2-codex` behind an OpenAI-compatible gateway: seven calls (`search`, `related`, `context`, `history` with `predicate=depth_mm`), the right tire, the right depth on 2026-09-20, and the threshold quoted from the cartridge rather than assumed. Any other MCP client works the same way: a stdio server, five tools, one tenant per server instance.

!!! note "Where is the graph stored?"
    In memory, for now. The MCP server ingests the stream at start and serves it. The durable store is the next item on the [roadmap](roadmap.md).
